# INFINITY/ COMPILER
### By: Eileen Karin Apaza Coaquira
## Description:
This project is a compiler for the Infinity programming language, developed for the Compiler course. It includes components for lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis.

## Features
Scanner (Lexical Analyzer): Implements logic to identify tokens, keywords, identifiers, integers, strings, and other lexical elements of the language.
Syntactic and Semantic Analysis: Includes functions to compute "first" and "follow" sets, as well as generating syntactic analysis tables for predictive descent analysis.
Data Structures: Utilizes lists and dictionaries to store grammar, first sets, follow sets, and syntactic analysis tables.
Language Grammar: Defines grammatical rules for statements, expressions, operators, data types, functions, and other language elements.

## Usage
Execution of the Lexical Analyzer (Scanner): Provide the source code as input to obtain associated tokens and types.
Syntactic and Semantic Analysis: Use the provided functions to perform syntactic and semantic analysis of specific source code defined in the language.
